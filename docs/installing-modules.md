# Installing modules

Whenever you import some module, Pyrun will attempt to auto install it for you.

## Supported packages

Pyodide comes with many [popular packages](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html) like pandas üêº and numpy.

You can also try to import other packages, they will be installed with [micropip](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/micropip-api.html).

Note that not all modules are compatible with Pyodide like `requests`.

For such modules you need to find alternatives.

Here's an example to replace `requests`:

```py title="js_fetch.py"
from js import console, fetch

async def print_pokemon_data(pokemon: str):
    response = await fetch(f"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{pokemon}")
    parsed = await response.json()
    pokemon_data = parsed.to_py()

    move_count = len(pokemon_data["moves"])
    poke_types = []
    for poke_type in pokemon_data["types"]:
        poke_types.append(poke_type["type"]["name"])

    print(f"{pokemon.title()} of type(s) {poke_types} has {move_count} moves!")

await print_pokemon_data("blaziken")
```

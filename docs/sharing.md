# Sharing

You can share content using Snappify by clicking: *Share Snippet*.

When you submit, the image is automatically added to your clipboard so you can paste it.

!!! note
    **Linkedin** doesn't support pasting images in posts, so whenever you're inside **Linkedin**, it will automatically **download the image**.
